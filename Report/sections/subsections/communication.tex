In order to represent communications between services in a realistic way, we opted for a two level representation:
\begin{itemize}
 \item At a lower level, physical links are represented as bidirectional links. This makes a little more
 complex the findRoute predicate, but also carries an advantage in representing the infrastructure, as
 we don't need to specify that a link exists in both direction: this is always assumed to hold.
 \item At a higher level, channels between services are assumed to be monodirectional. This seemed a reasonable choice, as channels are language constructs which allow the user to say "I want service X to send messages to service Y", embedding this information in a service definition.
\end{itemize}
