In Serverless computing, also known as functions-as-a-service, we are writing short-running, stateless functions that can be triggered by events generated from services or users.

We have to create a rule to register an action as a new consumer of a trigger.

A program consists of one or more rules; a rule is constructed by the when combinator over a given trigger and action.

rule(RuleName, TriggerId, ActionId)

Here, an action is a stateless function, uniquely identified by a name.

func(FId, ...)
